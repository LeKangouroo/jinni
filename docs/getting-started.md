# Getting Started

To install Jinni, all you need to do is to type the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g jinni
```

<br>

Then if you want to create a new project, simply use the **init** command like so:

```
jin init
```

That's it ! All you have to do now is to read the README.me file added in the current directory.

For the full list of available commands, use the `jin --help` command.
