# Introduction

Jinni is a command line boilerplate generator for front end development projets.
It's main goal is to create a ready-to-use codebase in no time, in a user-friendly manner.

The codebase includes some automated tasks such as minimization, image optimization,
ES2015 transpiling, unit / behaviour tests running, and more. See the [Features] section for more details.
